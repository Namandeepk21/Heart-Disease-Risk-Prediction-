# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-
 Description

This project is a Heart Disease Risk Prediction Web Application built using Streamlit and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model. It offers users an interactive platform to assess their potential risk of heart disease by inputting basic health-related parameters.

The application allows individuals to enter values such as their age, cholesterol level, ECG results, heart rate, and other clinical data via user-friendly sliders, dropdowns, and number inputs. Once submitted, the app processes the data using a pre-trained KNN model and provides an instant prediction: whether the individual is at high risk or low risk of heart disease.

To enhance user experience, the app uses custom HTML and CSS to create a clean, modern interface. A blurred background image of a heart-health theme is loaded directly using local HTML rendering, creating a professional aesthetic while keeping the focus on the prediction results. The entire app layout is responsive and centered inside a semi-transparent card-style container, maintaining readability and elegance.

The prediction model is backed by:

A trained and saved machine learning model (KNN_heart.pkl)

A scaler (scaler.pkl) to normalize inputs

A column schema (columns.pkl) to match the training structure


This application is ideal for:

ðŸŽ“ Students building ML portfolios

ðŸ©º Health tech proof-of-concept demos

ðŸ“Š Data science learners exploring deployment techniques

ðŸ’¼ Professionals showcasing end-to-end machine learning apps


With just a few lines of input and one click, the user receives not only a prediction but also a display of the input data for reference. Whether used as an educational tool or as a demo for ML capabilities, this app represents a complete mini-project from model development to deployment.
